# Implementation review log

This log records phase gates, findings, dispositions, checks and material
limitations. An independent review uses a new `gpt-6-astra` agent at `high`
effort with no inherited implementation conversation. Reviewers inspect the
requirements, code and tests directly and make no edits.

## Phase 1 — contract and foundations

Status: accepted; simplify and independent Astra high review gates passed.

- Baseline: `b09f705`.
- Working branch: `codex/implement-tasklease`.
- Ownership: protocol/codegen, TS/tooling, Python/tooling in parallel;
  supervisor owns integration and this log.
- Clarification: list operations use named arrays inside the common success
  object; see implementation checklist.
- Environment: Node 24.13.1 and uv 0.12.8 available. The npm safety wrapper
  initially failed to bind its local scanner socket in the sandbox; package
  operations may need sandbox escalation. No safety checks have been disabled.
- Simplify: three independent review-only passes (reuse, quality, efficiency)
  found no material simplification or confirmed defect. Quality recommended
  exercising compiled validators in Workers, which was added and passed.
- Independent Astra high review (`phase1_astra`, fresh `gpt-6-astra`, high):
  independently reran the full checks and monitor build. Found P2 empty TS
  request interfaces accepting primitives/arrays and P3 root Node engines
  including unsupported Node releases. Supervisor independently reproduced
  both against the compiler and installed package metadata. Closed-object
  codegen now emits `Record<string, never>` with positive and nine negative
  assignment fixtures; Node range is now `^22.12.0 || >=24`, including lockfile
  metadata. Focused Astra high re-review independently reproduced rejection of
  invalid assignments, verified engines, passed codegen/examples/strict TS,
  and found both issues resolved with no new material findings.
- Verification: supervisor `make check` passed (208 examples against both
  schema and standalone validators; 211 Python tests; strict TS/mypy,
  Ruff/ESLint/Prettier and Svelte checks). Final codegen drift/type fixtures
  passed. Worker dry-run and monitor production build passed. After adding the
  runtime validator check, strict TS and all three Workers-runtime tests passed.
- Platform references retrieved for implementation:
  [SQLite transactionSync](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/),
  [current Vitest plugin setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/write-your-first-test/),
  [DO runtime tests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/examples/testing-with-durable-objects/),
  [R2 presigned URLs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/presigned-urls/).
- Cloudflare account/token and R2 credential environment variables are unset;
  an existing Wrangler login has not yet been checked. Live acceptance remains
  pending.

## Phase 2 — service

Status: implementation starting after phase 1 acceptance.

- Scope: DomainObject operations, registry/auth/scopes/router, R2 signing,
  statistics and alarms, plus runtime behavioral tests.
- Simplify: pending.
- Independent Astra high review: pending.
- Verification: pending.
